# Predicting-Student-Dropout-and-Success-Using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning
We predict student dropout and success using 37 features and 4424 instances, including academic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. This three-category classification (dropout, enrolled, graduate) uses an 80/20 train-test split. Rigorous preprocessing handles anomalies, outliers, and missing values.
